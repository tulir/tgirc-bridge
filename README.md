# Telegram <-> IRC bridge
A fairly simple program to bridge a specific group on Telegram and a specific channel on IRC.

Use `go get maunium.net/go/tgirc-bridge` to download and compile

## No longer maintained
I've stopped using IRC in favor of [Matrix](https://matrix.org).

Alternative bridges for Matrix:
* [SijmenSchoon/telematrix](https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix) - Very similar to this bridge (uses bot on Telegram).
* [mautrix-telegram](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram) - A more advanced bridge that allows you to log in using your real Telegram account.
